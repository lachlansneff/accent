title: The End of the Beginning

Google Summer of Code is nearly done. I got a lot done this summer, but there is still a ways to go before Nebulet is usable in the real world!

--------

The original goals that I set for this program were:

1. Integrate Cretonne (now called Cranelift)
2. Develop an ABI
3. Create the usermode

Of course, developing an operating system is a fluid thing and goals are subject to change over time, but I've completed all three of these for the time being.

For the fall, my work on Nebulet is going to be sponsored by Oasis Labs. The goals I have for that time period are:

* Handle 100mbps network load.
* Build infrastructure for caching compiled-code.
* Demonstrate wasm running in Nebulet on riscv64.

with a stretch goal of implementing multiprocessor support.

I'll keep this blog updated periodically with progress updates.

Thanks you to all of you who have kept up with Nebulet over the past few months! Your interest and ideas are very important to me (and it helps keep me motivated).
